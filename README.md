API Tester using Django and React using a Todo List.

A simple program designed to get my feet wet with API calls and React. It is heavily followed from a tutorial but I still uploaded 
it so I can show that I experienced it, and to allow myself to view the code and to add features or build on it later. The best part 
of Django and React is how they are designed with modular pieces so I can reuse code.
